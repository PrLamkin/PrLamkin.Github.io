        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
            Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996. 
            The band currently consists of husband John (lead vocals, bass) and wife Korey Cooper (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) along with Jen Ledger (drums, vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar). 
            The band has released ten albums, with two, Collide and Comatose, receiving Grammy nominations. Two of their albums, Comatose and Awake, are certified Platinum and Double Platinum respectively by the RIAA, while Rise and Unleashed are certified Gold as of June 29, 2020.
             Five of their songs, "Whispers in the Dark", "Hero", "Monster" , "Awake and Alive", and "Feel Invincible", are certified Platinum, while other four, "Rebirthing", "Comatose", "Not Gonna Die", and "The Resistance" are certified Gold.
             Skillet went through several line-up changes early in their career, leaving founder John Cooper as the only original member remaining in the band. 
             They are known for a relentless touring schedule, which garnered them a top five ranking in the Hardest Working Bands of 2010 by <a href="https://blog.songkick.com/the-hardest-working-bands-of-2010-27c5f6d6b49" target="_blank">Songkick.com</a>
